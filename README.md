Week 3
1. Last week I mainly focused on gathering resources that will help me set the educational foundation for my project, which is to build a simple algorithmic trading model.

2. This week I began going through the materials listed above and researching what to base the algorithm on (e.g., moving averages).
3. I have not hit any impediments as of yet.
4. I did not focus on any coding this past week. Next week I will begin to build up the code base, such as getting the environment set up and importing data.
