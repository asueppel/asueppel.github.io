Week 03 Status Update
1. Last week I mainly focused on gathering resources that will help me set the educational foundation for my project, which is to build a simple algorithmic trading model.

2. This week I began going through the materials listed above and researching what to base the algorithm on (e.g., moving averages).
3. I have not hit any impediments as of yet.
4. I did not focus on any coding this past week. Next week I will begin to build up the code base, such as getting the environment set up and importing data.

Week 04 Status Update
1. This past week I finalized my project proposal (below) and began to setup my coding environment.
2. Next week I will continue to setup the coding environment (download all the dependencies and libraries) and get my personal website looking more professional.
3. To date, there have not been any impediments in my way.
4. Taking a note from Lindsay Kriz's post, it would be good for me to setup a formalized schedule for each week to ensure I stay on track.
