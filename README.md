Week 05 Status Update
1. I continued to work my way through the educational materials I found for creating a trading algorithm in Python.
2. Next week I will continue to go through these materials to create the basis of knowledge I need to implement my own algorithm.
3. To date, there have not been any impediments.
4. Figuring out how to spruce up my personal website is taking longer than I originally anticipated. I will likely need to set aside more time for this aspect of the project.

Week 04 Status Update
1. This past week I finalized my project proposal (below) and began to setup my coding environment.
2. Next week I will continue to setup the coding environment (download all the dependencies and libraries) and get my personal website looking more professional.
3. To date, there have not been any impediments in my way.
4. Taking a note from Lindsay Kriz's post, it would be good for me to setup a formalized schedule for each week to ensure I stay on track.

Week 03 Status Update
1. Last week I mainly focused on gathering resources that will help me set the educational foundation for my project, which is to build a simple algorithmic trading model.

2. This week I began going through the materials listed above and researching what to base the algorithm on (e.g., moving averages).
3. I have not hit any impediments as of yet.
4. I did not focus on any coding this past week. Next week I will begin to build up the code base, such as getting the environment set up and importing data.

Project Proposal
Vision Statement: I have worked in finance for my entire working career. Finance has becoming increasing reliant on big data and being able to process the data to gain actionable business insights. My project will focus on building a simple trading algorithm, which will require importing historical data, processing the data, and extracting trading signals from the processed data. This project will develop skills in sourcing and processing data, specifically as it relates to the financial world.

Motivation Statement: Beyond just working in finance, I have a particular interest in economics, as it was my original area of study. I am fascinated how prices in the stock market theoretically capture all publicly available information related to that stock. For example, supply chain disruptions or a drop in the price of silicon could potentially have a very meaningful impact on the price movement of Apple stock. While the algorithm I develop will not be advanced enough to quantify and process these types of information, even a simple trading algorithm will expand my knowledge as to how modern algorithmic trading models are designed and applied.

Specific Goals: Given the limited time allocated to this project (45 hours), my specific and measurable goals are as follows.
•	Identify a simple algorithm based on either technical analysis (e.g., using stock price and trading volume data) or a select input variables (e.g., high yield interest rates and a chosen stock market index).
•	Implement the chosen trading strategy in Python.
•	Be able to import and scrub data from external sources for processing by the implemented algorithm.
•	Be able to properly setup the Python environment and import the necessary libraries for the algorithm to function and potentially visualize the output.
•	Output trading signals to act on (trading actions).
•	Be able to back test the trading strategy from historical data.

Risks:
•	While I have a finance background, I do not have experience in building a trading algorithm.
•	I have experience in Python; however, the project may require the use of libraries or aspects of Python I do not have experience with.
•	It may be difficult to find the data I need to analyze for free.
•	The data needed for the project may be available but require a lot of cleaning for it to be useful for this project.

Mitigation Strategy: I did a fair amount of research on developing trading algorithms when choosing a topic for this project. There are a lot of resources in this area, specifically for using Python to create trading algorithms. For access to data, Kaggle has been a tremendous resource for free data that I have used in the past.


Project Assessment:
•	I am able to import and clean the necessary data.
•	The trading algorithm successfully processes the data and outputs actionable trading signals.
•	I am able to back test the performance of the algorithm using historical data.
